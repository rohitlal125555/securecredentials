# SecureCredentials

SecureCredentials is a lightweight Python package designed to securely store key-value pairs, such as passwords 
or other sensitive information, on disk. By leveraging modern AES-GCM 256-bit encryption and a dual encryption scheme, 
the package ensures that your sensitive data and encryption keys remain safe, while still providing convenient access 
for everyday use.

## Why SecureCredentials Was Created
This package was created to address two common challenges faced by developers:

1. **Avoid storing sensitive credentials in plaintext:** It is unsafe for developers to store credentials such as 
database passwords, Active Directory passwords, and API keys in plaintext within their scripts or configuration files.
2. **Eliminate the need to repeatedly enter passwords:** Developers often have to enter their credentials every 
time they run a script, which can be cumbersome and error-prone. SecureCredentials allows for automatic retrieval 
of encrypted credentials, eliminating the need to type them each time.

## Key Features

- **Dual Encryption Scheme**: Your actual credentials are encrypted with a strong master key, and that master key is 
itself encrypted using a deterministic AES-GCM 256-bit key derived from your local system environmentâ€”ensuring 
multi-layered protection.
- **AES-256 Encryption (GCM mode)**: Uses modern AES-GCM encryption with a 256-bit key for both speed and strong 
cryptographic security.
- **Local Security**: All keys and encrypted data are stored locally, ensuring that no sensitive data leaves your system.
- **Convenience**: Automates secure access to stored credentials, removing the need to retype passwords or store 
them in plaintext.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly across different operating systems, including Windows, Linux and macOS.

## Installation

To install SecureCredentials, run:

```bash
pip install securecredentials
```

## Dependencies

SecureCredentials requires the following Python libraries:

- **cryptography:** For encryption and decryption.
